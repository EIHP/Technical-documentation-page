<header><h3>CSS Introduction</h3></header>
<p>
  CSS layout is based principally on the box model. Each of the blocks taking up space on web page has properties like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>padding, the space just around the content (e.g., around paragraph text).</li>
<li>border, the solid line that sits just outside the padding.</li>
<li>margin, the space around the outside of the element.</li>
<li>background-color, the color behind an element's content and padding.</li>
<li>color, the color of an element's content (usually text).</li>
</ul>

<code><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">p</span> {
  <br>
  <span style="color:#9370DB;">color:</span> green;
  <br>
}
</code>

<header><h3>CSS Flexible Box Layout</h3></header>
<p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns.
  Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces.
  </p>
  <p>Select which elements are to be laid out as flexible boxes.
    Then set a special value of display on the parent element of the elements selected.</p>
<code><span style="color:#2F4F4F;"> section</span> {
  <br>
  <span style="color:#9370DB;">display:</span> flex;
  <br>
}</code>

<section class="main-section" id="CSS_Grid_Layout">
<header><h3>CSS Grid Layout</h3></header>
<p>CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web.
  It allows to lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts uncomplicated.
  To define a grid use the grid value of the display property. As with Flexbox, this switches on Grid Layout,
  and all of the direct children of the container become grid items.</p>
<code><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">.container</span> {
  <br>
  <span style="color:#9370DB;">display:</span> grid;
  <br>
  <span style="color:#9370DB;">grid-template-columns:</span>
  <span style="color:#9370DB;">200</span> px <span style="color:#9370DB;">200</span> px <span style="color:#9370DB;">200</span> px;
  <br>
  }

</code>
<p>A grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a pattern against which we can line up our design elements.
  They help us to create designs where elements don’t jump around or change width as we move from page to page,
  providing greater consistency on our websites. A grid will typically have columns, rows,
  and then gaps between each row and column — commonly referred to as gutters.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Media_queries">
<header><h3>Media Queries</h3></header>
<p>The CSS Media Query gives you a way to apply CSS only when the browser and device environment matches a rule that you specify,
  for example "viewport is wider than 480 pixels". Media queries are a key part of responsive web design,
  as they allow you to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport,
  but they can also be used to detect other things about the environment your site is running on,
  for example whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse.</p>

<p>The simplest media query syntax looks like this:</p>
<code><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">@media media-type and (media-feature-rule)</span>{
  <br>
  <span style="font-style:oblique;"> /*CSS rules go here*/ </span>
  <br>
}
</code>
<p>It consists of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A media type, which tells the browser what kind of media this code is for (e.g. print, or screen).</li>
    <li>A media expression, which is a rule, or test that must be passed for the contained CSS to be applied.</li>
    <li>A set of CSS rules that will be applied if the test passes and the media type is correct.</li>
  </ul>

<p>The following media query will only set the body to 12pt if the page is printed.
  It will not apply when the page is loaded in a browser.</p>
  <code><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">@media print</span> {
    <br>
    body {
      <br>
      font-size: 12pt;
      <br>
    }
    <br>
  }
  </code>
